Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) is a neurosurgical method to survey electrophysiological activity within the brain to treat disorders such as Epilepsy. In this stereotactic approach, leads are implanted through straight trajectories to survey both cortical and sub-cortical activity.

Visualizing the recorded locations covering sulcal and gyral activity while staying true to the cortical architecture is challenging due to the folded, three-dimensional nature of the human cortex. 

To overcome this challenge, we developed a novel visualization concept, allowing investigators to dynamically morph between the subjects' cortical reconstruction and an inflated cortex representation. This inflated view, in which gyri and sulci are viewed on a smooth surface, allows better visualization of electrodes buried within the sulcus while staying true to the underlying cortical architecture.
